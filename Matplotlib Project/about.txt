 Steps to solve -

        a. Load the dataset
        b. Clean the dataset
        c. Understand the dataset
        d. Identify the questions 
        e. Visualize the dataset (EDA)
        f. Save the plot

Types of charts and their use -

        a. How many movies VS TV shows -                                Bar chart
        b. what is the % of each content rating -                       Pie chart
        c. How many no. of releases changed over years -                Line plot
        d. Distribution of Movie Durations -                            Histogram
        e. Relationship b/w release year and no. of shows -             Scatter Plot (Optional)
        f. Top 10 countries with highest number of shows -              Bar chart
        g. Compare multiple plots together -                            Subplots
        h. Save final charts -                                          Saving Figures
